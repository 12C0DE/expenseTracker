Money Tracker is a React website used to keep track of expenses. 

Track expenses by category, see your total income / expenses, and your current balance, along with a transaction list of all transactions - with the ability to sort by amount or date. Add notes to each transaction for quick identification and even toggle each transaction easily as income or expense by the click of a button.

Money tracker uses Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for cloud database and Authentication/Authorization. This site is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and uses CI/CD once code changes are pushed to Github.
